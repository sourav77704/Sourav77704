## 🧪 Home Lab and Projects

### 🔐 pfSense Home Firewall Setup

I'm building a home firewall using **pfSense** on a **Dell OptiPlex 3070 Small Form Factor** desktop. Here's how it's set up:

- **Router**: NETGEAR XR1000-100APS  
- **NIC Upgrade**: Intel i210-T1 (single-port Gigabit NIC) — [$89 from Scorptec](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/networking/adapters/103015-interface Assignment
- `em0` (Intel i210-T1) → WAN (connected to NBN box)  
- `em1` (Onboard NIC) → LAN (connected to XR1000)

#### ⚙️ VLAN Configuration
- VLANs created in pfSense (e.g., VLAN 10 for IoT, VLAN 20 for Gaming, VLAN 30 for Work)  
- TP-Link switch configured with tagged trunk port and untagged access ports  
- XR1000 set to Access Point mode to avoid double NAT

#### 📈 Features Enabled
- 802.1Q VLAN tagging  
- QoS and IGMP Snooping  
- Port Mirroring for diagnostics
